He runs away after using magic to inflate Uncle Vernon's (Richard Griffiths') sister Marge (Pam Ferris), who was being offensive towards Harry's parents. Initially scared for using magic outside the school, he is pleasantly surprised that he won't be penalized after all. However, he soon learns that a dangerous criminal and Voldemort's trusted aide Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban Prison and wants to kill Harry to avenge the Dark Lord. To worsen the conditions for Harry, vile creatures called Dementors are appointed to guard the school gates and inexplicably happen to have the most horrible effect on him. Little does Harry know that by the end of this year, many holes in his past (whatever he knows of it) will be filled up and he will have a clearer vision of what the future has in store.",

That same year, Hogwarts is hosting \"The Triwizard Tournament\", a magical tournament between three well-known schools of magic : Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. The contestants have to be above the age of seventeen, and are chosen by a magical object called \"The Goblet of Fire\". On the night of selection, however, the Goblet spews out four names instead of the usual three, with Harry unwittingly being selected as the Fourth Champion. Since the magic cannot be reversed, Harry is forced to go with it and brave three exceedingly difficult tasks.",

    "Plot": "Bond, James Bond. Perhaps the greatest fictional cinema icon ever. He first appeared on the big screen in 1962 in Dr. No, and has remained the most powerful action hero ever since. The secret to his success is his adaptability. No matter what tight spot he finds himself, he always appears to be suave, sophisticated and cool. As a spy Bond is constantly reinventing himself, and on the big screen he has done this five times, as Sean Connery, Roger Moore, George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan. The documentary looks at the different characterizations each actor has brought to the role to discover the elements that make up Bond. It also traces the character back to its origin, the Bond novels by Ian Fleming, whose creation was semi-autobiographical. From the gadgets to the girls, The James Bond Story also features interviews with Q (the late Desmond Llewelyn), Maud Adams, Jane Seymour, Terence Young (Director), Cubby Broccoli (Producer), Ian Fleming and more, along with extensive film clips from Dr. No to The World is Not Enough. This action-packed documentary presents an in-depth look at the quintessential spy who has a license to kill.",
